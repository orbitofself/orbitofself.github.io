    <h1>Who We Are</h1>
    <p>
      <span class="highlight">s13</span> is a collective dedicated to digital accountability and justice. We operate within legal and ethical boundaries to investigate, expose, and report individuals who engage in harmful or criminal online behavior. Our work is driven by a firm belief in protecting vulnerable communities and upholding standards of human decency in digital spaces.
    </p>

    <h2>What We Do</h2>
    <p>
      Our core focus is identifying and reporting individuals who pose a threat to others online. This includes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><span class="highlight">Child predators and pedophiles</span> — those who exploit or endanger minors.</li>
      <li><span class="highlight">Extortionists</span> — individuals who threaten or manipulate others for gain.</li>
      <li><span class="highlight">Racists and hate-driven users</span> — spreading targeted harassment, bigotry, or incitement.</li>
      <li><span class="highlight">Repeat abusers</span> — accounts known for consistent violations of terms and safety.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      We collect and document evidence carefully, ensuring that accusations are grounded and supported. When appropriate, this information is submitted to relevant platforms or authorities for further action.
    </p>

    <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
    <p>
      The internet is not separate from reality. Harm done online has real consequences. We believe in using our skills and resources to create safer spaces for everyone — especially those most often targeted or silenced. s13 exists not to harass or dox, but to make sure the worst actors face real scrutiny and consequence.
    </p>

    <h2>Accountability & Responsibility</h2>
    <p>
      While our methods are vigilant, they are also responsible. We do not engage in random targeting, harassment, or baseless accusations. Every action we take is weighed against the core values of accuracy, justice, and proportionality. If we make a claim, we back it with verifiable data.
    </p>

    <p>
      We know the internet is full of shadows. Our job is to shine a light — carefully, and with purpose.
